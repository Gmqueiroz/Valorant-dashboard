This was a personal project I made in 2023 to practice my PowerBi skills and to help my University Valorant E-sports Team.

The data consists in Customs Games that our team played in the first semester of 2023.
All data was pulled manually from tracker.gg due to data mining limitation, the site now uses captchas and block the acess to crucial informations; I tried building an app with a friend, but they dont let us get data from customs even using their API.
The data was stored in a google spread sheet
So we have information of maps, agents, date, round won and lost and the normal stats of the game, like kills, assists, deaths, and others.

With all this data assembled was possible to get a bigger picture of our quality and problems.
